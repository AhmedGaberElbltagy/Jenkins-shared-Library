# Jenkins Shared Library

A Jenkins Shared Library is a powerful way to organize and reuse your Jenkins pipeline code across multiple projects. By centralizing common pipeline logic into a shared library, you can enhance code maintainability, reduce duplication, and ensure consistency across different Jenkins jobs. This approach not only saves time but also makes it easier to apply updates or changes to your pipeline logic without needing to modify each pipeline individually.

## Why Use a Jenkins Shared Library?

- **Code Reusability**: Shared libraries allow you to write your pipeline code once and reuse it across multiple Jenkins projects. This reduces redundancy and ensures that all projects follow the same build, test, and deployment processes.

- **Maintainability**: With shared libraries, any update or improvement made to the shared codebase is instantly available to all projects using the library. This makes maintaining and upgrading your CI/CD processes easier and more efficient.

- **Consistency**: By using a shared library, you can enforce consistent practices across all your Jenkins pipelines. This ensures that every project follows the same standards and guidelines, reducing the risk of errors.

- **Scalability**: As your projects grow, managing individual Jenkins pipelines can become cumbersome. A shared library allows you to scale your pipeline management by centralizing common tasks and workflows.

## Structure

The shared library is structured as follows:
